# shell scripts 
Scripts I use to pimp out my shell. #bash4lyf, dawg. 

## bigrm

- Sometimes bash will refuse to rm * if there are too many files in a directory.  This works around that.
- language: perl

## hogs

- print current system resource usage.
- includes load, process info, disk stats via iostat & hdparm, disk usage, network speed
- see sample report for more info.
- language: perl

## listrepos

- If using ssh/gitolite, connecting via ssh will list the repos the current user has access to. This simple script does that.  There's not much to it. It's barely even a script.
- language: python

## gzmaybe

- gzip or gunzip a list of files, keep whichever version is smaller.
- language: python

## ytaudio
- Extract the audio from a youtube video.  Convert to mp3 if desired.  Interactive menu.
